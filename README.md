# Dynamic Tree Data Structures
Java swing desktop application. The objective is implement all tree data structures with dynamic operations. This means that create the tree and every operation goes to the tree created. Then studied they times and costs. All data structures is on [Structure](./src/DynamicTreeStructures/structure/)

## AVL Tree
In process [AVL Tree](./src/DynamicTreeStructures/structure/AVLTree.java) [Node](./src/DynamicTreeStructures/structure/NodeAVLTree.java)

## Rooted Binary tree
In process [Rooted Binary Tree](./src/DynamicTreeStructures/structure/RootedBinaryTree.java) [Node](./src/DynamicTreeStructures/structure/Node.java)


## Red Black Tree
In process [Red Black Tree](./src/DynamicTreeStructures/structure/RedBlackTree.java) [Node](./src/DynamicTreeStructures/structure/RedBlackTreeNode.java)
