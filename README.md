# Dynamic Tree Data Structures
Java desktop application. The objective is implement all tree data structures with dynamic operations. This means that create the tree and every operation goes to the tree created. Then studied they times and costs. All data structures is on [Structure](./src/DynamicTreeStructures/structure/)

## Full Binary Tree

## Balanced Binary Tree

## Complete Binary Tree

## Red Black Tree
In process [Red Black Tree](./src/DynamicTreeStructures/structure/RedBlackTree.java) [Node](./src/DynamicTreeStructures/structure/RedBlackTreeNode.java)
